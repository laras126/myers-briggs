# "Myers Briggs for Web People" or "The Unicorn Test" or "Are You Really Full Stack"

When it comes to roles within the web development industry, there is _a lot_ of overlap and, unsurprisingly, our means of describing what we do or what we are hiring for is lacking. Job titles are slowly evloving from:
"Front-end Developer"
"UI/UX Developer and Interaction Designer"
"Web Designer and Developer"
to
"UX Developer"
"Front-end Developer (React)"
"Senior Front-end Engineer (Angular)"
"Mid-Level Full Stack Designer and Developer"

This has resulted in the phrase "full stack developer" which, in many cases, translates to the never present "unicorn". This is a quiz to help both employers and potential employees figure out the their position on the spectum.

To be answered on a scale of Don't Agree to Strongly Agree, this survey will give a guage of your expertise in terms of back-end and programming skills, front-end and UI/UX development, and design.
