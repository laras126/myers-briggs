# Myers Briggs for Web People

When it comes to roles within the web development industry, there is _a lot_ of overlap and as an industry in its awkward 20s, our means of describing what we do or what we are hiring for is lacking. This is a survey/quiz modeled on the Myers Briggs psychology test to help both employers and potential employees figure out where they lie on the spectrum of web development.

Each question is to be answered on a scale of 0 (disagree) to 4 (agree), and will gauge your expertise in terms of back-end/CS skills, front-end and UI/UX development, JavaScript, and design.
