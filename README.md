# Myers Briggs for Web People

When it comes to roles within the web development industry, there is a lot of overlap and - as an industry in its awkward 20s - our means of describing what we do or what we are hiring for is lacking.

Each question is to be answered on a scale of 0 (disagree) to 4 (agree), and will gauge your expertise in terms of for categries:

- front-end/UI development (HTML/CSS)
- JavaScript
- design

- How difficult is the question, from 1-5?
