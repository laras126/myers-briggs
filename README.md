# "Myers Briggs for Web People"

When it comes to roles within the web development industry, there is _a lot_ of overlap and, unsurprisingly, our means of describing what we do or what we are hiring for is lacking. Job titles are slowly evloving from:

* "Front-end Developer"
* "UI/UX Developer and Interaction Designer"
* "Web Designer and Developer"

to

* "UX Developer"
* "Front-end Developer (React)"
* "Senior Front-end Engineer (Angular)"
* "Mid-Level Full Stack Designer and Developer"

This has resulted in the phrase "full stack developer" which, in many cases, translates to the never present "unicorn". This is a quiz to help both employers and potential employees figure out the their position on the spectum.

To be answered on a scale of Don't Agree to Strongly Agree, this survey will give a guage of your expertise in terms of back-end and programming skills, front-end and UI/UX development, and design.
